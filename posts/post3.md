## Why Blogging?

Blogging is a great way to share knowledge, document learning, and build a personal brand. Here are a few reasons why I decided to start blogging:

1. **Share Knowledge**: Blogging allows me to share insights and knowledge with a wider audience.
2. **Learn by Teaching**: Writing helps reinforce my understanding of topics.
3. **Build a Portfolio**: Over time, a blog can serve as a portfolio of knowledge and projects.
